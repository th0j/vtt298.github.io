# Introduction
Step by step building a scalable web application with React and Ruby on Rails on AWS

# Overview of the Architecture:
Our AWS architecture is designed to be highly available, scalable, and secure. Here's a high-level overview of the key components:
- Amazon VPC: Provides a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud.
- Public and Private Subnets: Enhance security by separating public-facing and internal resources.
- Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling: Hosts our React frontend and Rails backend applications.
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- Amazon RDS: Manages our database with options for high availability.
- Amazon ElastiCache: Improves performance through caching.
- Amazon CloudFront: Serves as a CDN to deliver content globally with low latency.
- AWS CloudWatch: Monitors our application and infrastructure.

# Step by step guide

## 1. Setup VPC


## 2. Create Security Groups

## 3. Set Up RDS


## 4. Deploy Your Rails Backend

### 4.1 Create an EC2 for your Rails app:

### 4.2 Create an Auto Scaling group

### 4.3 Create an Application Load Balancer for the backend


## 5. Deploy Your React Frontend

## 6. Set Up Monitoring and Logging

# Common Issues & Troubleshooting
- If your backend can't connect to RDS, double-check the security group rules.
- If the frontend can't reach the backend, ensure the ALB DNS name is correctly configured in your React app.
- For slow response times, check your Auto Scaling group settings and consider adjusting the scaling policy.

# Summary
Congratulations! You've successfully set up a scalable architecture for your React and Ruby on Rails application on AWS.
